PROJECT TITLE: Shepar Fairey Lab
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To Create a Cool Image by manipulaing color of pixels
VERSION or DATE: 11/11/22

Method 1: 
Split pixels into four equal buckets based off of grayscale values 
and gave them a new color based off of how light or dark they were.

Method 2:
Added up all of the R G B values to create a variable called intensity,
the more intense a color is, the more light it is. Then finding the most 
intense and least intense pixel, I divided the space between those two
into four equal parts and distributed the pixels amongst them. This is 
a more accurate version of the first method because it distributes the pixels
more fairly, however it looks quite similar if not identical to method
1 when outputted.

Method 3 - Attempt 1:
Used a similar approach to method 2, however I divided the pixels into
six equal parts rather than 4. I also gave a new turquoise / green color
pallette. It needs some more contrast.

Method 3 - Attempt 2:
I changed the color pallete to include some dark and light green and hot pink.
The colors are more contrasting, but now they are too contrasting.

Method 3 - Attempt 3:
Tried adding more green and orange, however this only backfired the coloring further.
Needs a better color pallete that contrasts slightly less but still has a fair 
amount of contrast.

Method 3 - Final Attempt:
Used a light to navy blue color pallette, featuring 10 colors. First I made the darkest color
only work for the darkest of colors, and the light colors appear more frequently, since
the colors are generally dark. Once I found a variation of colors I liked, I edited the image 
so that the background was a solid color and I added text above and below.
